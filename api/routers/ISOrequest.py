    """
    The ISORequester backend component allows users to request items or services through
    the application, functioning similarly to current ISO management practices.
    Users can specify various details about the item or service they are seeking,
    including title, optional description, optional image, and the price they are
    willing to pay. These requests are then uploaded to the database for recording
    and tracking purposes.

    Once a transaction related to a request is successfully completed, the requester
    has the capability to mark this in their post. This action automatically updates
    the transaction's status as complete in the transaction history database, providing
    a record of the completed transaction.

    Attributes:
        title (str): The title of the item or service being requested.
        description (str, optional): A more detailed description of the item or service.
        image (Image, optional): An image representing the item or service.
        price (float): The price the requester is willing to pay. Must be non-negative.

ISSUES DISCOVERED:

Non-negative Price Validation:
Issue: The initial code did not validate the non-negative price on the backend.
Risk: Without backend validation, there was a possibility of negative prices "screwing up" the database integrity.

Editing/Deleting ISO Requests:
Issue: The program lacked the ability for users to edit or delete their ISO requests.
Risk: This limitation restricted user control and could lead to outdated information existing in the database.

Image Handling Post-Upload:
Issue: There was no clarification or implementation detail on the restrictions for image size and format.
Risk: Without such restrictions, users could upload excessively large or improperly formatted images, potentially leading to storage inefficiencies or technical issues.

Notification System Integration:
Issue: There was no mention of a notification system to alert users of important events related to their ISO requests.
Risk: Users might not be promptly informed about significant updates, potentially degrading the user experience.

Security Measures:
Issue: The preliminary design did not address security measures such as authentication and authorization for accessing and modifying requests.
Risk: Neglecting security could lead to unauthorized access and manipulation of user data.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES MADE:

Non-negative Price Validation:
Change: Added a validator within the ISOrequesterFilters Pydantic model to check for non-negative prices.
Reason: Backend validation ensures integrity even if frontend validation fails or is bypassed, safeguarding the database against corrupt data.

Editing/Deleting ISO Requests:
Change: Introduced new endpoints for updating and deleting ISO requests, along with proper permission checks.
Reason: This allows users to maintain accurate and current information and removes any obsolete data, enhancing user control and data relevance.

Image Handling Post-Upload:
Change: Included comments about handling images with specific size and format restrictions post-upload.
Reason: Outlines the need to enforce these limitations to maintain efficient storage and prevent technical issues.

Notification System Integration:
Change: Added comments discussing the potential integration of a notification system.
Reason: To improve user engagement by keeping users updated about the status of their ISO requests and related transactions.

Security Measures:
Change: Ensured all sensitive endpoints require user authentication, and only appropriate users can perform actions.
Reason: To protect user data and prevent unauthorized actions, upholding the applicationâ€™s integrity and trustworthiness.
